    					<p>At Merit Tutors, we understand the importance A Level results play when it comes to university applications. A Level content can be difficult to understand so we have introduced our intensive Easter Revision course to reinforce the key concepts and techniques to enhance and improve our student’s understanding. We aim to challenge our students to ensure they are confident and prepared to achieve their potential in their final exams</p>
    				<p>During our intensive revision course, our tutors take the time to understand each student’s needs, adapting their teaching styles and strategies to ensure our students get the most out of their lessons. Our Easter revision courses are structured around practising as many past papers, mastering a key exam skill. </p>
    				<p>Our Intensive A Level revision course is designed for Year 12 and Year 13 pupils preparing for their final AS or A-Level exam. Our main focus is ensuring that students receive the support and assistance required. For this reason, our group size has been limited to 4-6 students from the same year group, to ensure that our students receive individual help whilst also benefitting from a group setting. Our A Level groups consist of AS and A2 learners, allowing the AS students to learn advanced techniques early and be ahead of their peers, while simultaneously allowing our A2 pupils to significantly improve their knowledge and technique for their exams. The course is designed to fit the needs of our students, following a logical sequence of learning and balancing tuition between content, skills and exam practice.</p>
