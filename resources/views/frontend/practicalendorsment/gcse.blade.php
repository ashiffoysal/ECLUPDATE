                              <p>Exam Centre London offers the opportunity for candidates to sit GCSE practical exams for biology, chemistry and physics. We will be holding these sessions in nearby secondary schools, all within the borough of Newham. To ensure that you receive the best experience, Exam Centre London will provide highly qualified and competent science tutors to carry out these practical lessons. There will be practice lessons where candidates will be taught how to accurately and confidently manage equipment and tutors will also provide clear and concise instructions on how to conduct experiments.</p>
                              <p>Sessions will be held in local state schools during the spring half term to ensure that candidates can maximise the use of the labs and equipment. This will also ensure there are no disturbances and candidates are able to participate during sessions in a comfortable manner.</p>
                              <p>Practice practical sessions will be led by one member of staff and five candidates with the opportunity for candidates to familiarise themselves with the lab and equipment and present any queries. During practice sessions, tutors will also allow candidates the opportunity to conduct these experiments individually and provide feedback on improvements. Tutors will also provide tips and tricks on how to conduct these practical assessments and how to efficiently manage time.</p>
